PYDroid library for pyamsoft applications

## What is PYDroid

PYDroid is the **py**amsoft An**droid** library. It contains common
functions and classes that are used in multiple pyamsoft projects.
It is an always changing, always actively developed library, and as
such is not meant for use outside of pyamsoft projects.

**It is not written with public usage in mind** and will **not** be taking pull
requests on GitHub or elsewhere for new features, unless it will result
in less duplication of effort across other pyamsoft applications.
